# The Task

Deutschland Public Transport has a public REST API which offers the possibility to different programmers to freely gather real time information about traffic data, bus station stops and departures, trams and much more... This API does not require any authentication to ping it. You can find the needed documentation here: https://v5.db.transport.rest/api.html. 

The task consist of creating a simple website which will contain a map integrated from google maps. When you click at a specific point over the Deutschland map it will list the 5 nearest bus stations to your location.
